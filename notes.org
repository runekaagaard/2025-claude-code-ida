** How does this work
- Foo
** And this?
- NICE!?
- WOOT?

* Getting started
- max plan, can't share email with team, use an alias
- npm install
- cd to ROOT of directory and claude --mcp-config --continue/resume
- settings/permissions/etc.

* Optimize for Quality
- When reaching the valley of confusion backtrack and carve a new path
- Minimize available tools. Build your own domain specific tools with as few num as possible
- Keep it simple, BREAD
- llm docs
- CLAUDE.md
- It's random try again. Hard to get a instinct for random quality

* Usage
- Research, use many tokens
- Think hard, harder, ultrathink
- Normal, Auto Accept, Planning
- Memory
- Don't code.
- Branch golden context
- Don't compact

* Workspaces
- A fast way to get to a running workspace. If it's OK to have bad dev workflows in an org it's also OK to have
  bad code and deployment practices

* Commands
- VERY useful

* Agents
- Doesn't share context
- Great for tangential work
- Circuit break not great

* Results
- Is it faster? Probably not, but it's fun
- GREAT for prototyping, boilerplate, extending existing welldefined systems
- BAD for loose specs in strict environments

* Research
- Does commands flood context
- Does @ flood context

* Misc
- Producing AI content is great, consuming kind-a-sucks
- If you merge it you own it so better be sure it's a great solution
- Use AI generation time for thinking, planning, testing and reading the code
- Random
- Inner imports
- 25000, workaround use filesystem mcp server

* Misc2
- git hook til code format, AFTER
- clg
- clean top of imports, before/after comments
