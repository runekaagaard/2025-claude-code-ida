- Make Claude use a lot of tokens
- Great way to refresh own understanding
- Follow up for additional details
- Stepwise approach makes for good todo items

Hi Claude, let's start by researching how [TOPIC] works in the system.

First read:
- The current issue in [PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL]
- Any referenced emails
- Relevant documentation in the @llm folder

Then read these core files in full:
- @[FILE_1]
- @[FILE_2]

After that, reference relevant classes in [LONG_FILE] and do additional research as needed.

Finally, summarize your findings.

*** Tooling
#+begin_src bash
# Get absolute paths for files
$ realpath [file1] [file2]
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(defun rk-realpath ()
  "Copy the full path of current buffer to kill ring"
  (interactive)
  (kill-new (buffer-file-name))
  (message "Copied: %s" (buffer-file-name)))

(defun rk-realpath-visible-buffers ()
  "Copy a newline separated list of full paths of visible buffers to kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (let ((paths '()))
    ;; Collect paths from all visible buffers
    (dolist (frame (frame-list))
      (dolist (window (window-list frame))
        (let* ((buffer (window-buffer window))
               (path (buffer-file-name buffer)))
          (when path
            (push path paths)))))

    ;; Create newline separated string and kill it
    (let ((paths-str (mapconcat #'identity (delete-dups (nreverse paths)) "\n")))
      (kill-new paths-str)
      (message "Copied %d visible buffer paths" (length (split-string paths-str "\n" t))))))

** Planning
*** Talk
- What are we building
- How will we build it
- Don't use plan mode
- "Don't code yet" - just planning

*** Claude
#+begin_src markdown
Today we are building [FEATURE]. I'm thinking we use this overall approach:

- [STEP_1]
- [STEP_2]
- [STEP_3]

Any questions? Feel free to do additional research before we start coding.
