Hi Claude, lets start out by researching how [topic] works in the system. First read the current issue in [project management tool] and any referenced emails as well as any relevant docs in the @llm folder. Then read these files in full:

- @src/apps.py
- @src/urls.py

After that reference relevant classes in /home/r/ws/2025-claude-code-ida/myproject/src/longfile.py and do addtional relevant research.

Finally summarize your findings.

Today we are building [feature], I'm thinking we are using this overall approach

- foo
- bar

Any questions? Feel free to do additional research.
